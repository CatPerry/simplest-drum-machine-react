Step 0: Once you npm start you should see a gray background. Familiarize
        yourself with the code here. We have two components. An App.jsx 
        file and a Button.jsx file. Look at each of those and think about
        how we'll need those to interact. Notice that our App render function
        has an event listener on the window object for any key press. Look at 
        the handleKeydown function and think about how this is working?

Step 1: To make sure everything is hooked up properly, first render a 
        <Button /> by putting one in the buttons array like so [<Button />]. 
        Now put a few more in there. How is this working? ðŸ¤” Have a look
        at the Button.jsx file. We are creating a Button component and exporting 
        that component. At the top of this file, you'll notice that we're
        importing the button component. Every <Button /> is a placeholder for
        all the code inside the render method of the Button.jsx file.
        
Step 2: Create a for loop from 0 to 16 in order to push sixteen buttons
        to the buttons array. On each iteration, push a <Button /> component 
        to that array â€” your page should now be displaying 16 buttons.
        
Step 3: Let's add some props for each button. Create a prop called id and assign 
        to it the value of i. Your buttons array should now have 16 buttons each
        with a unique id like so <Button id={i} />. Create a key prop and also
        assign to it the value of i. 
        
Step 4: Create three more props: keyCode, keySymbol, and audioFile
        Assign to these props the current element from the this.state.keyCodes,
        this.state.keySymbols, and this.state.audioFiles arrays, respectively.

BONUS: Let's make our buttons work when we click on them. First, create a 
       handleKeydown prop on every button and assign this.handleKeydown to it.
       Now navigate to the Button.jsx file and add an onClick property to the 
       div, assigning to it this.props.handleKeydown (NB: we would usually 
       create a separate click handler method, but since the functionality is 
       roughtly the same we'll go ahead and just make a slight modification to 
       handleKeydown). Finally, back in App.js modify the line just below 
       handleKeydown and change it from "let code = e.keyCode;" to 
       "let code = e.keyCode || e.target.children[1].id"

BONUS 2: Change the key mappings to different keys. How can we do this? Start
        by console.logging some keyCodes. Try pressing different keys and getting
        the key codes for those keys. Modify those properties in state to change
        the key mappings. You'll also have to change some of the elements in the 
        keySymbols array so the buttons show the correct mappings. Finally, you'll
        notice that there are some other drum loops in the samples folder. Reassign
        some of the keys to play some of those drum samples instead.
